# Affinity Maturation System

## Overview

The Affinity Maturation System is a sophisticated component of the Phytovenomics platform that optimizes the binding properties of designed antibodies against snake toxin targets. Inspired by the natural process of somatic hypermutation, this system employs computational techniques to enhance antibody-antigen interactions, improving both binding affinity and specificity.

## Features

- **In Silico Affinity Maturation**: Simulates the natural antibody affinity maturation process
- **CDR Optimization**: Focuses optimization on the complementarity-determining regions
- **Binding Energy Calculation**: Estimates binding energy between antibodies and toxin targets
- **Specificity Enhancement**: Optimizes for both affinity and specificity across toxin variants
- **Developability Preservation**: Maintains key antibody developability properties during optimization
- **Evolutionary Search**: Implements directed evolution approaches to explore sequence space
- **Statistical Coupling Analysis**: Identifies co-evolving residue positions for targeted mutations

## Architecture

![Affinity Maturation Architecture](../assets/affinity_maturation_architecture.png)

The Affinity Maturation System consists of several integrated components:

1. **Sequence Mutator**: Generates targeted mutations in antibody sequences
2. **Structure Predictor**: Predicts 3D structures of mutated antibodies
3. **Binding Calculator**: Calculates binding energies between antibodies and toxins
4. **Fitness Evaluator**: Evaluates overall fitness based on multiple criteria
5. **Evolution Manager**: Coordinates the iterative optimization process

## Usage

```python
from phytovenomics.antibody_design import AffinityOptimizer

# Initialize the affinity optimizer
optimizer = AffinityOptimizer(config_path="config/affinity_maturation_config.yaml")

# Load antibody sequences and their target toxins
antibodies = [...] # List of antibody sequences
toxins = [...] # List of corresponding toxin sequences

# Optimize antibodies for improved binding
optimized_antibodies = optimizer.optimize_affinity(
    antibodies=antibodies,
    targets=toxins,
    iterations=100,
    population_size=50
)

# Calculate binding energies
binding_energies = optimizer.calculate_binding_energies(
    antibodies=optimized_antibodies,
    targets=toxins
)

# Export results
optimizer.export_results(
    antibodies=optimized_antibodies,
    binding_data=binding_energies,
    output_path="results/optimized_antibodies.csv"
)

# Visualize optimization trajectory
optimizer.visualize_optimization_trajectory(
    output_path="results/optimization_trajectory.png"
)
```

## Optimization Methodology

The Affinity Maturation System employs a multi-stage optimization process:

1. **Initial Population Generation**:
   - Start with candidate antibodies from the Antibody Generator
   - Generate initial population with controlled diversity

2. **Iterative Optimization**:
   - Mutation: Generate sequence variants focused on CDR regions
   - Structure Prediction: Predict 3D structures of variants
   - Binding Calculation: Estimate binding energy to target toxins
   - Selection: Select top performers based on fitness function
   - Recombination: Generate new variants through crossover

3. **Convergence and Selection**:
   - Monitor optimization convergence
   - Apply final selection criteria
   - Rank optimized candidates

## Mutation Strategies

The system implements several mutation strategies:

- **CDR-Focused Mutations**: Higher mutation rates in CDR regions
- **Contact-Based Mutations**: Prioritize residues in the binding interface
- **Statistical Coupling Analysis**: Target co-evolving positions
- **Conservative Substitutions**: Favor substitutions that preserve physicochemical properties
- **Structure-Guided Mutations**: Use structural information to guide mutations

## Fitness Evaluation

The fitness function evaluates candidates based on multiple criteria:

- **Binding Energy**: Calculated using molecular mechanics or statistical potentials
- **Specificity**: Ratio of binding to target vs. binding to decoys
- **Developability**: Assessment of factors like solubility, stability, and expression
- **Humanness**: Degree of similarity to human antibody sequences
- **Plant Expression Compatibility**: Compatibility with plant expression systems

## Integration

The Affinity Maturation System integrates with:

- **Antibody Generator**: Receives initial antibody candidates
- **Hybrid Prediction Pipeline**: Utilizes structure prediction for binding assessment
- **Evolutionary Search Module**: Leverages evolutionary algorithms for optimization
- **Validation Metrics Tracker**: Monitors optimization progress
