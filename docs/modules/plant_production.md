![Plant Production Architecture](../assets/plant_production_architecture.png)

The Plant Production Optimization module consists of several integrated components:

1. **Sequence Optimizer**: Optimizes antibody sequences for plant expression
2. **Vector Designer**: Creates optimized genetic constructs for transformation
3. **Expression Predictor**: Predicts expression levels in different plant systems
4. **Process Optimizer**: Optimizes growth and extraction parameters
5. **Quality Controller**: Ensures quality standards for produced antibodies

## Usage

```python
from phytovenomics.plant_production import PlantExpressionOptimizer, ProcessDesigner

# Initialize the plant expression optimizer
expression_optimizer = PlantExpressionOptimizer(config_path="config/plant_production_config.yaml")

# Optimize antibody sequence for plant expression
optimized_sequence = expression_optimizer.optimize_sequence(
    antibody_sequence="EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSSYWMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVAN...",
    plant_host="nicotiana_benthamiana",
    subcellular_localization="apoplast"

# Design expression vector
vector_design = expression_optimizer.design_vector(
    optimized_sequence,
    vector_type="plant_binary",
    promoter="35S",
    terminator="nos"
)

# Export vector design
expression_optimizer.export_vector_design(vector_design, "results/plant_expression_vector.gb")
