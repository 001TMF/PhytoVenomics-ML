# Cocktail Formulator

## Overview

The Cocktail Formulator is a specialized component of the Phytovenomics platform responsible for designing optimal antibody cocktails that effectively neutralize snake venoms. This module leverages computational methods to combine individual antibodies into synergistic mixtures, maximizing coverage against diverse toxins while minimizing the total number of components required.

## Features

- **Coverage Optimization**: Maximizes toxin neutralization coverage across snake species
- **Synergy Analysis**: Identifies antibody combinations with synergistic effects
- **Component Minimization**: Minimizes the number of antibodies needed for effective neutralization
- **Cross-Reactivity Assessment**: Evaluates antibody cross-reactivity across toxin families
- **Toxin Prioritization**: Weights cocktail composition based on toxin medical importance
- **Geographic Tailoring**: Designs region-specific cocktails based on local snake species
- **Manufacturing Constraints Integration**: Incorporates expression yield and production considerations

## Architecture

![Cocktail Formulator Architecture](../assets/cocktail_formulator_architecture.png)

The Cocktail Formulator consists of several integrated components:

1. **Coverage Analyzer**: Analyzes toxin coverage of individual antibodies
2. **Synergy Calculator**: Assesses synergistic effects between antibody pairs
3. **Cocktail Optimizer**: Optimizes antibody combinations using mathematical programming
4. **Production Evaluator**: Assesses manufacturability of proposed cocktails
5. **Stability Predictor**: Evaluates the stability of antibody combinations

## Usage

```python
from phytovenomics.cocktail_formulation import CocktailFormulator

# Initialize the cocktail formulator
formulator = CocktailFormulator(config_path="config/cocktail_formulator_config.yaml")

# Load antibodies and their toxin neutralization profiles
antibodies = [...] # List of antibody objects with neutralization data
toxin_map = {...} # Dictionary mapping toxins to their medical importance scores

# Create optimized cocktail formulations
cocktails = formulator.design_cocktails(
    antibodies=antibodies,
    toxin_importance=toxin_map,
    max_components=8,
    coverage_threshold=0.95
)

# Evaluate cocktail performance
performance = formulator.evaluate_cocktails(cocktails, detailed=True)

# Export results
formulator.export_cocktails(cocktails, performance, "results/optimized_cocktails.csv")

# Visualize cocktail coverage
formulator.visualize_coverage(cocktails[0], "results/cocktail_coverage.png")
```

## Optimization Methodology

The Cocktail Formulator employs several optimization approaches:

### Mathematical Programming

The core optimization uses mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to find optimal antibody combinations:

- **Objective Function**: Minimize the weighted sum of included antibodies
- **Constraints**:
  - Achieve required coverage for each toxin
  - Respect maximum component count
  - Consider antibody compatibility constraints
- **Decision Variables**: Binary variables indicating antibody inclusion

### Greedy Approximation

For larger problems, a greedy algorithm approach is also available:

1. Start with an empty cocktail
2. Iteratively add the antibody providing the greatest increase in coverage
3. Continue until coverage threshold or component limit is reached

### Genetic Algorithm

For complex cases with non-linear synergy effects:

1. Encode cocktail compositions as binary strings
2. Evaluate fitness based on coverage and component count
3. Evolve population through selection, crossover, and mutation
4. Extract best solutions after convergence

## Coverage Calculation

The system employs several methods to calculate toxin coverage:

- **Binary Coverage**: Simple binding/non-binding determination
- **Affinity-Based**: Coverage proportional to binding affinity
- **Neutralization-Based**: Based on in silico neutralization predictions
- **Synergy-Aware**: Includes cooperative effects between antibodies

## Geographic Tailoring

The Cocktail Formulator supports geographic customization:

- **Region Definition**: Define regions based on snake species presence
- **Species Importance**: Weight species by medical importance in each region
- **Venom Composition**: Account for regional variation in venom composition
- **Custom Formulations**: Generate specialized formulations for different regions

## Integration

The Cocktail Formulator integrates with:

- **Venom Intelligence Module**: Receives toxin prioritization data
- **Antibody Generator**: Receives candidate antibodies
- **Affinity Maturation System**: Receives binding affinity data
- **Production Optimization System**: Feeds cocktail formulations for production planning
