# Antibody Generator

## Overview

The Antibody Generator is a core module of the Phytovenomics platform designed to engineer human antibodies that target identified epitopes on snake toxins. Using advanced machine learning techniques and protein design principles, this module creates antibody sequences with optimal binding properties for neutralizing snake venoms.

## Features

- **Antibody Scaffold Selection**: Identifies optimal human antibody scaffolds for engineering
- **CDR Design**: Designs complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to target specific epitopes
- **Framework Optimization**: Optimizes framework regions for stability and expression
- **ML-Guided Sequence Generation**: Employs deep learning models to generate candidate antibody sequences
- **Humanization**: Ensures antibodies maintain human-like sequences to minimize immunogenicity
- **Plantability Assessment**: Evaluates sequences for compatibility with plant expression systems

## Architecture

![Antibody Generator Architecture](../assets/antibody_generator_architecture.png)

The Antibody Generator consists of several integrated components:

1. **Scaffold Selector**: Selects appropriate human antibody scaffolds based on epitope characteristics
2. **CDR Designer**: Designs CDR regions to target specific epitopes
3. **Sequence Generator**: Generates full antibody sequences based on scaffold and CDR designs
4. **Humanization Engine**: Ensures antibody sequences remain humanized
5. **Plant Expression Optimizer**: Optimizes sequences for expression in plant systems

## Usage

```python
from phytovenomics.antibody_design import AntibodyGenerator

# Initialize the antibody generator
generator = AntibodyGenerator(config_path="config/antibody_generator_config.yaml")

# Load epitopes
epitopes = [...] # List of epitope sequences or objects

# Generate antibodies targeting these epitopes
antibodies = generator.generate_antibodies(
    epitopes=epitopes,
    num_candidates=10,
    optimize_for_plants=True
)

# Export results
generator.export_antibodies(antibodies, "results/candidate_antibodies.csv")

# Generate visualizations
generator.visualize_antibody(antibodies[0], "results/antibody_visualization.png")
```

## Design Methodology

The Antibody Generator employs a multi-stage design process:

1. **Scaffold Selection**: Select human antibody scaffolds that provide suitable frameworks
2. **Epitope Analysis**: Analyze epitope properties to guide CDR design
3. **CDR Design**:
   - Generate candidate CDR sequences using ML models
   - Score candidates for binding potential
   - Select top-performing CDRs
4. **Framework Refinement**: Optimize framework regions for stability and expression
5. **Full Antibody Assembly**: Combine optimized CDRs with framework regions
6. **Sequence Validation**:
   - Check humanness score
   - Evaluate developability parameters
   - Assess plant expression compatibility

## Machine Learning Models

The module leverages several machine learning models:

- **ESM-1b**: Pre-trained protein language model for generating antibody sequences
- **AbLang**: Language model specifically trained on antibody sequences
- **IgFold**: Deep learning model for antibody structure prediction
- **CDR-H3 Designer**: Specialized model for designing the crucial CDR-H3 region

## Plant Expression Optimization

The module incorporates specific optimizations for plant expression systems:

- **Codon Optimization**: Adapts codon usage for efficient expression in target plant species
- **Signal Peptide Selection**: Identifies optimal signal peptides for plant secretion
- **N-Glycosylation Site Management**: Removes or preserves N-glycosylation sites based on configuration
- **Proteolysis Site Avoidance**: Minimizes sites susceptible to plant proteases
- **ER Retention Signals**: Adds appropriate signals for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum if needed

## Integration

The Antibody Generator integrates with:

- **Epitope Discovery Engine**: Receives prioritized epitopes for targeting
- **Affinity Maturation System**: Passes generated antibodies for further optimization
- **Hybrid Prediction Pipeline**: Utilizes structure prediction to evaluate designs
- **Validation Metrics Tracker**: Evaluates antibody quality metrics
