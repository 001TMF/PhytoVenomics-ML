# Hybrid Prediction Pipeline

## Overview

The Hybrid Prediction Pipeline is a sophisticated component of the Phytovenomics platform that combines multiple computational methods to accurately predict antibody-antigen interactions. By integrating sequence-based, structure-based, and machine learning approaches, this module provides robust predictions of binding affinities, epitope mapping, and structure-function relationships critical for antibody design and optimization.

## Features

- **Binding Affinity Prediction**: Estimates binding affinities between antibodies and toxin targets
- **Structure Prediction**: Generates 3D structural models of antibodies and complexes
- **Epitope Mapping**: Predicts binding interfaces between antibodies and toxins
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence metrics for predictions
- **Ensemble Learning**: Leverages multiple prediction methods to improve accuracy
- **Visual Analysis**: Provides visualization tools for predicted structures and interfaces

## Architecture

3. **Docking Engine**: Predicts antibody-toxin complex structures
4. **ML Predictor**: Uses machine learning for binding affinity prediction
5. **Ensemble Integrator**: Combines predictions from multiple methods

## Usage

```python
from phytovenomics.hybrid_prediction import HybridPredictor

# Initialize the hybrid predictor
predictor = HybridPredictor(config_path="config/hybrid_prediction_config.yaml")

# Predict binding for antibody-toxin pair
binding_result = predictor.predict_binding(
    antibody_sequence="EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSSYWMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVAN...",
    toxin_sequence="MKTLLLTLVVVTIVCLDLGYTRICFNHQSSQPQTTKTCSPGESSCYNKQWSD...",
    prediction_level="comprehensive"
)

# Analyze result
print(f"Predicted binding affinity: {binding_result['affinity']} nM")
print(f"Confidence score: {binding_result['confidence']}")

# Generate 3D structure of the complex
complex_structure = predictor.predict_complex_structure(
    antibody_sequence="EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSSYWMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVAN...",
    toxin_sequence="MKTLLLTLVVVTIVCLDLGYTRICFNHQSSQPQTTKTCSPGESSCYNKQWSD..."
)

# Export structure
predictor.export_structure(complex_structure, "results/antibody_toxin_complex.pdb")

predictor.visualize_complex(
    complex_structure, 
    highlight_interface=True,

   - Process antibody and toxin sequences
   - Extract sequence-based features

2. **Structure Prediction**:
   - Predict 3D structure of antibody using IgFold
   - Predict toxin structure if not available
   - Generate preliminary complex model

3. **Binding Interface Prediction**:
   - Predict binding interface residues

   - Generate final binding prediction with confidence score

## Performance Metrics

The pipeline evaluates predictions using multiple metrics:

- **Binding Affinity Correlation**: Pearson/Spearman correlation with experimental data
- **Interface Prediction Accuracy**: F1-score for interface residue prediction
