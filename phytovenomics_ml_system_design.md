# Phytovenomics ML System Design

## Implementation approach

For the Phytovenomics ML Platform to design human antibodies against snake venoms, we'll implement a comprehensive terminal-based Python program that leverages modern machine learning techniques. The architecture will focus on these key components:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Robust ETL processes for handling antibody and toxin data from various sources, including SAbDab integration for enhanced datasets.

2. **ML Core Components**: Implement state-of-the-art models including ESM-2 transformer for CDR masking/prediction, evolutionary search with RosettaFold integration, and hybrid structure prediction with ESMFold and AlphaFold.

3. **Optimization Engine**: Advanced multi-objective optimization for antibody cocktail formulation using Pareto frontier techniques.

4. **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive validation metrics tracking for model performance evaluation.

5. **CLI Interface**: Terminal-based interface with batch processing capabilities for ease of use.

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Primary Programming Language**: Python 3.9+ for compatibility with ML libraries
- **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch for deep learning components, scikit-learn for traditional ML algorithms
- **Structure Prediction**: Integration of ESMFold and AlphaFold via their Python APIs
- **Optimization**: Custom implementation of evolutionary algorithms with NSGA-II for Pareto frontier calculation
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and seaborn for visualization components, with optional integration of PyMOL for structural visualization
- **Testing**: pytest for unit and integration testing
- **Documentation**: Sphinx for code documentation

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will use a modular, object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns between components. See the detailed class diagram in `phytovenomics_class_diagram.mermaid`.

The key classes in the system include:

1. **DataManager**: Handles loading, preprocessing, and management of all data resources.
2. **AntibodySequence** and **ToxinSequence**: Core data structures for antibody and toxin sequences.
3. **BindingPair**: Represents antibody-toxin binding relationships with affinity data.
4. **ESM2TransformerModel**: Implements the ESM-2 transformer for CDR masking and prediction.
5. **CDRProcessor**: Handles identification and processing of CDR regions in antibodies.
6. **EvolutionarySearch**: Implements evolutionary algorithms for antibody sequence optimization.
7. **RosettaFoldClient**: Provides an interface to RosettaFold for structure prediction and energy assessment.
8. **HybridStructurePredictor**: Combines ESMFold and AlphaFold for improved structure prediction.
9. **ParetoCocktailOptimizer**: Implements multi-objective optimization for antibody cocktail design.
10. **ValidationMetrics**: Provides comprehensive validation and metrics tracking.
11. **PhytovenomicsML**: The main class coordinating the entire pipeline.
12. **CLIInterface**: Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Program call flow

The system follows a modular workflow with clear separation between components. See the detailed sequence diagram in `phytovenomics_sequence_diagram.mermaid`.

The main program flows include:

1. **Initialization and Configuration**: Loading configuration and initializing all components.
2. **Data Loading**: Loading toxin, antibody, and binding pair data.
3. **Training Mode**: Training the ESM-2 transformer model on antibody sequences.
4. **Antibody Design Pipeline**: Designing antibodies against specific toxins.
5. **Cocktail Design Pipeline**: Optimizing antibody cocktails for multiple toxins.
6. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Comprehensive evaluation of designed antibodies.
7. **Batch Processing Pipeline**: Processing multiple toxins in batch mode.

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Hardware Requirements**: The current design assumes standard computational resources, but structure prediction models like AlphaFold typically require GPU acceleration. The implementation may need adjustments based on available hardware.

2. **Integration with External Services**: The design assumes local deployment of all models, but some components like RosettaFold might be more efficiently used as external services. API keys or service endpoints would need to be configured accordingly.

3. **Data Scalability**: While the design accommodates the current dataset sizes, scaling to much larger datasets (e.g., millions of sequences) would require additional considerations for distributed processing and database integration.

4. **Validation Data Availability**: The comprehensive validation framework assumes availability of ground truth data for metrics calculation, which may be limited for novel antibody designs.

5. **Real-time Requirements**: The current design prioritizes accuracy and optimization over speed. If real-time responses are needed, the architecture may need modifications for faster inference paths.

6. **User Expertise Level**: The CLI interface assumes users with bioinformatics expertise. Additional documentation or a simplified interface might be needed depending on the target users.
