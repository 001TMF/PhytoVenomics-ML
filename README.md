# Phytovenomics: Plant-Produced Universal Antivenom Platform

## Project Overview

Phytovenomics is a cutting-edge platform that integrates computational biology, machine learning, and plant biotechnology to develop universal antivenom solutions. The platform enables the design, optimization, and production of antibody-based antivenoms in plant expression systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional antivenom production methods.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete workflow from toxin analysis to antibody cocktail formulation
- **ML-Driven Design**: Machine learning algorithms for epitope discovery and antibody optimization
- **Plant Production**: Optimized for expression in plant systems like *Nicotiana benthamiana*
- **Modular Architecture**: Independent modules that work together seamlessly
- **Data-Driven**: Integrates toxin databases, antibody binding data, and production parameters

## Modules

### 1. Venom Intelligence

Analyzes snake venom proteomics data to identify and prioritize toxins for targeting. Considers toxin abundance, toxicity, conservation across species, and geographical distribution.

### 2. Epitope Discovery

Identifies optimal binding sites on toxin targets using structural analysis, evolutionary conservation, and machine learning prediction models.

### 3. Antibody Generator

Designs antibodies against selected epitopes using AI-driven techniques and immunoinformatics principles.

### 4. Affinity Maturation

Improves antibody binding affinity through computational evolution and structure-guided optimization.

### 5. Hybrid Structure Prediction

Predicts the 3D structures of antibody-toxin complexes to validate binding and neutralization potential.

### 6. Cocktail Formulator

Optimizes combinations of antibodies to create synergistic cocktails with maximal coverage across multiple toxin types and snake species.

### 7. Plant Production Optimization

Optimizes antibody sequences for plant expression, selecting optimal promoters, signal peptides, and codon usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see `setup.py`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd phytovenomics

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run the setup script
