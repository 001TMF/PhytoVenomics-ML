# ESM-2 Transformer System Design for Antibody Design

## Introduction

This document outlines the system design for the ESM-2 transformer implementation in the Phytovenomics ML Platform. The ESM-2 transformer is a state-of-the-art protein language model that has been adapted for antibody design, specifically for predicting and generating Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) and predicting binding affinity between toxins and antibodies.

## System Overview

The ESM-2 transformer implementation consists of several components:

1. **ESM-2 Core Model**: Pre-trained protein language model from Facebook Research that provides contextual embeddings for protein sequences.
2. **CDR Processing**: Identifies and processes CDR regions in antibody sequences.
3. **CDR Masking and Prediction**: Predicts masked CDR regions in antibody sequences.
4. **Antibody Generation**: Generates novel antibody sequences by modifying CDRs.
5. **Binding Prediction**: Predicts binding affinity between toxins and antibodies.
6. **Configuration System**: Manages model and training parameters.

## Architectural Components

### 1. ESM-2 Configuration

The configuration system is implemented as a dataclass (`ESM2Config`) with the following components:

- **Model Configuration**: Parameters for the ESM-2 model such as architecture, embedding dimensions, and attention heads.
- **Training Configuration**: Learning rate, batch size, epochs, and other training parameters.
- **CDR Masking Configuration**: Parameters for masking CDRs during training and inference.
- **Antibody Generation Configuration**: Parameters for generating new antibody sequences.
- **Binding Prediction Configuration**: Parameters for predicting binding between toxins and antibodies.
- **Dataset Configuration**: Train/validation/test splits and data augmentation parameters.
- **Checkpoint Configuration**: Parameters for saving and loading model checkpoints.
- **Device Configuration**: CPU/GPU selection.

The configuration can be loaded from and saved to YAML files, providing a flexible way to adjust model behavior without changing code.

### 2. CDR Processor

The CDR Processor identifies and extracts CDR regions from antibody sequences using established numbering schemes. Key functionalities include:

- **CDR Identification**: Uses pattern recognition and numbering schemes to identify CDRs in antibody sequences.
- **CDR Extraction**: Extracts CDR sequences from antibody sequences.
- **CDR Masking**: Masks specific CDR regions for prediction.
- **CDR Replacement**: Replaces CDR regions with new sequences.

### 3. ESM-2 CDR Model

The ESM-2 CDR Model is the core component that leverages the pre-trained ESM-2 transformer for antibody design tasks. Its key components include:

#### 3.1 Model Initialization

- Loads the pre-trained ESM-2 model and tokenizer.
- Initializes additional layers for CDR prediction and binding prediction.
- Sets up the device (CPU/GPU) for computation.

#### 3.2 CDR Masking and Prediction

- **Masking**: Replaces CDR regions with mask tokens.
- **Encoding**: Encodes masked sequences using the ESM-2 tokenizer.
- **Forward Pass**: Processes encoded sequences through the ESM-2 model.
- **Prediction**: Uses task-specific prediction heads to predict masked CDRs.

#### 3.3 Antibody Generation

- **Template Processing**: Processes template antibody sequences.
- **CDR Modification**: Modifies specific CDR regions to generate novel antibodies.
- **Diversity Control**: Controls the diversity of generated CDRs.
- **Validation**: Ensures generated sequences maintain structural constraints.

#### 3.4 Binding Prediction

- **Cross-Attention**: Uses cross-attention to capture interactions between toxins and antibodies.
- **Binding Score**: Predicts a binding score between toxin and antibody pairs.
- **Epitope Identification**: Identifies potential epitopes on toxins.

## Data Flow

### 1. CDR Prediction Flow

1. Input antibody sequence is processed by the CDR Processor to identify CDR regions.
2. Specific CDRs are masked in the sequence.
3. Masked sequence is encoded and processed through the ESM-2 model.
4. CDR prediction head generates predictions for the masked regions.
5. Predictions are converted back to amino acid sequences.

### 2. Antibody Generation Flow

1. Template antibody sequence is processed to identify CDRs.
2. Selected CDRs are masked in the template sequence.
3. For each masked CDR, new sequences are predicted using the ESM-2 model.
4. Generated CDR sequences are inserted back into the template sequence.
5. Generated antibodies are validated for structural constraints.

### 3. Binding Prediction Flow

1. Toxin and antibody sequences are encoded separately.
2. Sequence embeddings are processed through the ESM-2 model.
3. Cross-attention is applied to capture interactions between sequences.
4. Binding prediction head generates a binding score.
