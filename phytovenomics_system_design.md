# Phytovenomics Setup System Design

## Implementation approach

The Phytovenomics setup system is designed to provide a robust, user-friendly way to initialize the project environment, manage dependencies, and download required machine learning models. The system addresses several challenges:

1. **Heterogeneous environment support**: The system supports different environments (development, testing, production) with varying requirements.

2. **Large model file management**: The project relies on machine learning models that are too large to include in the repository, requiring a secure and efficient download mechanism.

3. **System compatibility validation**: The setup ensures the user's system meets the necessary requirements before installation.

4. **Dependency consistency**: Managing Python package dependencies across different environments and ensuring compatibility.

### Selected Technologies and Libraries

- **Click**: For building a friendly command-line interface with proper argument handling
- **PyYAML**: For configuration file parsing and management
- **tqdm**: For displaying progress bars during model downloads
- **requests**: For reliable HTTP downloads of model files
- **packaging**: For version parsing and comparison
- **psutil**: For system resource checking (memory, disk space)

### System Architecture

The setup system follows a modular architecture built around specialized manager classes:

1. **SetupManager**: Orchestrates the entire setup process
2. **ConfigManager**: Handles loading and managing configuration settings
3. **EnvironmentManager**: Creates and configures Python virtual environments
4. **DependencyManager**: Installs and verifies Python package dependencies
5. **ModelManager**: Downloads and verifies machine learning model files
6. **SystemValidator**: Validates system requirements
7. **Logger**: Provides consistent logging throughout the setup process

This modular approach allows for:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and extension
- Better testing of individual components
- Flexibility in configuration

## Data structures and interfaces

Please refer to the `phytovenomics_class_diagram.mermaid` file for a complete visualization of the class structure.

Key classes include:

- **SetupManager**: Orchestrates the setup process
  - Coordinates all other components
  - Manages the overall setup workflow
  - Generates setup reports

- **ConfigManager**: Handles configuration
  - Loads configuration from YAML files
  - Provides environment-specific settings
  - Manages configuration updates

- **EnvironmentManager**: Manages Python environments
  - Creates virtual environments
  - Validates environment setup

- **DependencyManager**: Handles Python packages
  - Installs core and environment-specific dependencies
  - Verifies installed packages
  - Generates dependency reports

- **ModelManager**: Manages ML models
  - Downloads model files from remote servers
  - Verifies model checksums
  - Extracts and manages model files

- **SystemValidator**: Validates system requirements
  - Checks Python version
  - Verifies available disk space
  - Tests for GPU/CUDA availability
  - Checks memory resources

- **Logger**: Handles logging
  - Logs to console with color coding
  - Logs to files for later review
  - Supports multiple log levels

- **SetupCLI**: Command-line interface
  - Provides user-friendly commands
  - Handles command-line arguments
  - Displays appropriate feedback to users

## Program call flow

Please refer to the `phytovenomics_sequence_diagram.mermaid` file for a visualization of the program flow.

The setup process follows this general flow:

1. **User initiates setup**: The user runs the setup script with appropriate arguments
2. **Configuration loading**: The system loads configuration from files
3. **System validation**: The system checks if the user's computer meets requirements
4. **Environment setup**: A Python virtual environment is created and configured
5. **Dependency installation**: Required Python packages are installed
6. **Model download**: Required machine learning models are downloaded and verified
7. **Final configuration**: Project-specific settings are configured
8. **Testing**: Optional verification tests are run
9. **Report generation**: A summary report is presented to the user

## Integration with existing project structure

The setup system integrates with the existing Phytovenomics project as follows:

1. **Directory structure**:
   - The setup module is located at `phytovenomics/setup/`
   - Configuration files are stored in `config/`
   - Downloaded models are placed in `models/`
   - Log files are written to `logs/`

2. **Entry point**:
   - The main setup script is at `scripts/setup.py`
   - Users can run this script directly with Python

3. **Configuration**:
   - Default configuration is generated if none exists
   - Environment-specific configurations are supported
   - User configuration overrides are preserved

## Security Considerations

1. **Model integrity verification**: All downloaded models are validated using MD5 checksums
2. **Secure downloads**: HTTPS is used for all model downloads
3. **Isolated environments**: Virtual environments isolate dependencies from the system

## User Experience

The setup system prioritizes user experience through:

1. **Clear feedback**: Colored console output shows progress and status
2. **Progress indicators**: Download progress bars show status for large files
3. **Helpful error messages**: When issues occur, clear guidance is provided
4. **Environment guidance**: Instructions are provided for activating environments

## Extensibility

The system is designed for extensibility:

1. **Modular architecture**: New components can be added with minimal changes
2. **Configuration-driven**: Most changes can be made via configuration
3. **Component independence**: Each manager can be used independently

## Anything UNCLEAR

There are a few aspects that might need clarification as the project evolves:

1. **Model hosting strategy**: The current design assumes models are hosted on a stable, accessible server. If models need to be distributed through other channels (e.g., private repositories, torrents), the ModelManager would need to be extended.

2. **Authentication requirements**: If the model download server requires authentication, the system would need to be extended to handle credentials securely.

3. **OS-specific optimizations**: While the system is designed to be cross-platform, certain optimizations might be beneficial for specific operating systems.

4. **GPU framework preferences**: The current design checks for GPU availability generically, but might need to be extended to check for specific frameworks (PyTorch vs. TensorFlow) based on project evolution.
