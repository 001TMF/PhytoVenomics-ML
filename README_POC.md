# Phytovenomics Proof of Concept Pipeline

This document provides instructions for setting up and running the Phytovenomics proof-of-concept pipeline test. The test demonstrates the complete workflow from snake toxin data analysis to antivenom cocktail formulation.

## Overview

The Phytovenomics platform integrates several modules to design plant-produced antibodies against snake toxins:

1. **Venom Intelligence**: Analyzes toxin data and prioritizes targets
2. **Epitope Discovery**: Identifies targetable regions on toxins
3. **Antibody Generator**: Designs antibodies against selected epitopes
4. **Affinity Maturation**: Improves antibody binding affinity
5. **Hybrid Prediction**: Predicts 3D structures and binding interactions
6. **Cocktail Formulator**: Designs optimal antibody combinations
7. **Production Optimization**: Optimizes for plant manufacturing

The proof-of-concept test simulates this entire pipeline using mock implementations and test data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   

3. Install dependencies:
   
   
   If no requirements.txt exists, install the needed packages manually:
   

## Directory Structure Setup

Create the necessary directories and test data:



## Running the Proof-of-Concept Test

1. Run the test:
   

2. Review the test output. The test will:
   - Process mock toxin data through each module of the pipeline
   - Generate a visualization showing cocktail coverage
   - Produce a summary report of the pipeline results
   - Create JSON files with cocktail formulation and production parameters

## Examining Results

After running the test, the following output files will be generated in the `results/` directory:

- **antivenom_cocktail.json**: Details of the optimized antibody cocktail
- **production_parameters.json**: Plant production optimization parameters
- **cocktail_coverage.png**: Visualization of toxin coverage
- **pipeline_summary.md**: Comprehensive report of the pipeline results

## Next Steps

The proof-of-concept test demonstrates the potential of the Phytovenomics approach. For a real implementation:

1. Replace mock implementations with actual module code
2. Use real toxin and antibody data instead of synthetic examples
3. Implement proper ML training and prediction instead of simulated results
4. Validate results against experimental binding and neutralization data

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing module error**: Make sure you are running the script from the project root directory
- **Visualization error**: Ensure matplotlib is properly installed
- **Data loading error**: Check that the test data file was created correctly
