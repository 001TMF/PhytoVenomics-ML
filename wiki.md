# Project Summary
Phytovenomics is a cutting-edge platform that integrates computational biology, machine learning, and plant biotechnology to develop universal antivenom solutions. The platform enables the design, optimization, and production of antibody-based antivenoms in plant expression systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional antivenom production methods. It focuses on engineering broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) and specific neutralizers to combat snake envenomations, enhancing public health through innovation in antivenom production.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
1. **Venom Intelligence Module**: Analyzes and clusters snake toxins using a comprehensive database.
2. **Epitope Discovery Engine**: Identifies potential epitopes on toxins for targeted antibody design.
3. **Antibody Generator**: Designs human antibodies against identified epitopes.
4. **Affinity Maturation System**: Optimizes binding properties of designed antibodies.
5. **Cocktail Formulator**: Creates effective antivenom mixtures by optimizing antibody combinations.
6. **Hybrid Prediction Pipeline**: Integrates ESMFold and IgFold for enhanced antibody structure predictions.
7. **Evolutionary Search Module**: Implements evolutionary algorithms with RosettaFold integration to optimize antibody sequences.
8. **Validation Metrics Tracker**: Monitors and evaluates model performance against various metrics.
9. **Visualization Utilities**: Visualizes antibody evolution and structure.
10. **Plant Production Optimization**: Maximizes expression and purification of antibodies in plant systems.
